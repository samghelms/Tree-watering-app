# Tree watering app

## Step-by-step on how we built it

1. Beginning
	a. Open your terminal. Cd into your documents folder (type "cd ~/Documents/" into your terminal) then create a projects folder ("mkdir projects") and cd into it ("cd projects"). Then git clone the repository ("git clone https://github.com/samghelms/Tree-watering-app.git" in the terminal).
	b. Once the repository has finished cloning, install npm dependencies. To do this, type "npm install" into your terminal (navigate into the "/Documents/projects/Tree-watering-app" folder if you aren't there already).
	c. Install the expo app on your iphone (https://expo.io/tools). You can find it by searching for "expo" in the itunes store. Open the expo app.
	d. Type "npm start" into your terminal (still in the "/Documents/projects/Tree-watering-app" folder) and then scan the barcode using the expo app. 
	e. Exit out of the server (ctrl+c twice in the terminal).
	f. Create a branch for yourself on git. (Note: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials can serve as a reference for all these steps).
